## Users API

This is a small API which will be used for API workshops. The backend is json file. 

In order to run this locally, here are preconditions:

 1. Install brew

    ``/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"``

2. Install node

https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node


3. Clone the repo

4. cd into project folder

5. ``npm install``

6. ``node index.js``

The server is running on port 3000, so go to **http://localhost:3000/users** to test
